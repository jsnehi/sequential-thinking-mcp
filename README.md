# Sequential Thinking API
A FastAPI-powered sequential thinking framework that combines structured problem-solving methodologies with AI-enhanced analysis. This system helps break down complex problems into manageable, sequential stages while providing intelligent insights at each step
## Overview
Sequential Thinking API is inspired by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) sequential thinking approach, designed to facilitate systematic problem-solving through defined cognitive stages. Unlike scattered, unorganized thinking, this system guides you through a structured process that mirrors how expert problem-solvers approach complex challenges.

*What Makes This Special?*
- *Structured Framework*: Organizes thinking through 5 proven cognitive stages
- *AI-Enhanced*: OpenAI GPT-4 integration provides intelligent analysis and suggestions
- *Progress Tracking*: Visual timeline and comprehensive session management
- *Iterative Process*: Build upon previous thoughts with contextual awareness
- *Persistent Sessions*: Save and revisit complex thinking processes
- *Production Ready*: Built with FastAPI for scalability and performance

## The Sequential Thinking Framework
*The Five Stages*: Our framework follows a proven cognitive methodology:
- Problem Definition    â†’  Clearly articulate what you're solving
- Research             â†’  Gather relevant information and context
- Analysis             â†’  Break down and examine the components
- Synthesis            â†’  Integrate findings into coherent solutions
- Conclusion           â†’  Finalize decisions and action plans


*Why This Approach Works*

- *Prevents Analysis Paralysis*: Clear structure keeps you moving forward
- *Reduces Cognitive Bias*: Systematic approach minimizes mental shortcuts
- *Improves Decision Quality*: Thorough process leads to better outcomes
- *Enables Collaboration*: Shared framework facilitates team problem-solving
- *Creates Documentation*: Natural record of reasoning process

## Key Features

- **Core Functionality**
  - *Structured Thinking Sessions*: Create and manage multiple concurrent problem-solving sessions
  - *AI-Powered Analysis*: Each thought receives intelligent analysis and improvement suggestions
  - *Progress Tracking*: Visual timeline showing your journey through the thinking process
  - *Contextual Awareness*: AI considers previous thoughts when analyzing new ones
  - *Metadata Rich*: Track tags, axioms, assumptions, and other thinking artifacts

- **AI Integration**
  - *Thought Analysis*: GPT-4 evaluates each thought's quality and suggests improvements
  - *Next Step Guidance*: AI recommends what to explore next based on your progress
  - *Session Insights*: Comprehensive analysis of your entire thinking process
  - *Bias Detection*: AI helps identify potential blind spots and assumptions
  - *Quality Assessment*: Evaluation of reasoning strength at each stage

- **Management Features**
    - *Timeline Visualization*: See your thought progression chronologically
    - *Summary Generation*: Automatic summaries with stage distribution and insights
    - *Export Capabilities*: JSON export for integration with other tools
    - *Health Monitoring*: Built-in health checks and status monitoring
    - *Session Management*: Create, track, and organize multiple thinking sessions
